Distributed algorithms are not swarm algorithms but related. Thus, we put them in a special package to let you know that
they have special requirements and are not robust.

Distributed Algorithms are not directly applicable to swarm robots. They mostly assume a perfect static network, which
is not available in swarms. However, distributed algorithms can often be adapted for less stable environments or we can
assume that the connection between the robots is reliable and they do not move. For theoretical considerations proved
algorithms may be a big advantage. If a problem is not solvable as a distributed algorithm, it is probably also not
solvable with swarm robots. So if you are trying to find a solution, trying it first as distributed algorithms may be a
way to go.
